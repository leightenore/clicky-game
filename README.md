## Description

A simple game built with React. The user starts by clicking one of the images on the page. When an image is clicked, the images will be shuffled on the page. Each time the user clicks an image, their score will increase by one, and they keep going until each image has been clicked once. If the same image is clicked twice, the game is over and the score resets to zero.
